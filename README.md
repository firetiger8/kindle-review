# Classifying Kindle Book Reviews with Text Analytics 

This is a personal project that i created for RMDS Data Scientist Program.

Leveraged Text Analytics and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in Python to build a sentiment classifier for Kindle Book user reviews. This tool categorizes reviews into "Bad," "Neutral," and "Good" ratings, providing valuable insights into reader sentiment and potential book performance.
